# apps/web

This is the **canonical web application** location for PlayProof.

## Status

Currently a placeholder. When ready, scaffold a Next.js app here:

```bash
cd apps/web
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir
```

## Why This Folder Exists

Per `AGENTS.md`, this folder **must exist on all branches** to prevent merge conflicts. It serves as the canonical path for the primary web application.
