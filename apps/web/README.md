# apps/web

This is the **canonical web application** for PlayProof.

## Getting Started

From this folder:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

## Notes

- This folder must exist on all branches (see `AGENTS.md`).
- `demo-app/` remains the legacy/demo Next.js app for testing until explicitly deprecated.
